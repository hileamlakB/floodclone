October 17-18: Improved philosphy
    - CheckBrainstroming.md
        - definined a utility function
        - created redistirbution factor instead of high bandwidth (for priortization)
        - redistribution factor function still needs to be decided
        - grounded the system design philosphies on the utility function calcuation  

Ocotober 19: Implemented fileManager in python
    - While implementing the FileManager class in python I and measing performance
    I realized it taks a long time to split files and shoul only be don in parallel, which 
    isn't well suported in python and thus have made the decision to transfer implementing this program in 
    c++

October 20: Implemented thread pool
    - I decided I will neeed a thread pool that will be used by among all classes
    - Moreover all classes might have their functions called within a thread
    so it is impotant to make classes thread safe and also use the thread pool 
    insdie the classes to get optimum result.
    - Had to install g++-multilib for fsanitizer support make sure to include that
    in the installation guide (sudo apt-get install g++-multilib)


Nov 4: Completed the sender file manager class
    - had to install sudo apt-get install libssl-dev for managing md5checksum
    - which might not be requried and could be removed to speed up code
    - Created differnt methods for the filemanager class, including 
    - Make sure the send fucntion could run a thread safe way when the piece being sent isn't 
    avialable, if it isn't avialable it shoudl sleep and wake up again so that available pieces
    could be sent
